# Responses

#### 1) What is Web development?

# Web development refers to the process of creating, building, and maintaining websites or web applications that are accessed via the internet. It involves a variety of tasks, technologies, and disciplines aimed at designing the structure, functionality, and user experience of web-based software. Web development can range from creating simple static pages to complex, interactive, and dynamic web applications.

#### 2) What is Frontend development?

# Frontend Development:

    Focuses on the client side (what users see and interact with).

# What is client side?

     Computers connected to the internet are called clients and servers. A simplified diagram of how they interact might look like this:

     Clients are the typical web user's internet-connected devices (for example, your computer connected to your Wi-Fi, or your phone connected to your mobile network) and web-accessing software available on those devices (usually a web browser like Firefox or Chrome).

# The frontend Involves languages and technologies like:

    # HTML (HyperText Markup Language): For structuring content.
    # CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): For styling and layout.
    # JavaScript: For interactivity and dynamic functionality.
    # Frameworks and libraries such as React, Angular, or Vue.js are commonly used to simplify and enhance frontend development.

#### 3) What is Backend development?

# Focuses on the server side (the behind-the-scenes processes).

# what is server side?

    Servers are computers that store webpages, sites, or apps. When a client device wants to access a webpage, a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be displayed in the user's web browser.

# Manages databases, server logic, authentication, and the integration of third-party services.

# Common backend technologies include:

    Programming languages like Python, PHP, Ruby, Java, C#, or JavaScript (Node.js).
    Frameworks such as Express.js, Django, Flask, Ruby on Rails, or Spring Boot.
    Databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or SQLite.

#### 4) What is FullStack development?

# Combines both frontend and backend development.

# Full-stack developers are skilled in both areas and can handle the entire web development process.

#### 5) What tool you need to get started?

# a) Text editor:

# **Why do we need a text editor?**

    - **A text editor is essential for web development because it's the primary tool used to write and edit code. Here's why we need one:**
    - **It provides syntax highlighting to make code more readable and help catch errors**
    - **It offers features like auto-completion and code suggestions to make coding more efficient**
    - **It helps maintain proper code formatting and indentation**
    - **It allows you to manage multiple files and projects easily**
    **Web editor example on the market:**

    - Sublime text
    - Atom
    - Vs Code

# b) A Web Browser

    A web browser is a software application that allows you to access, view, and interact with websites on the internet. It translates web code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) into the visual pages we see and use daily.

    Examples of a web browsers:

    Chrome

    Mozilla

    Safari (for macOs, iOs)
